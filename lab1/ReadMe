My program is straightforward enough for graders. This Readme is in case that there is something wrong with my code and I need to debug. If graders cannot get perfect outputs during make or grading from my source code, this Readme may guide me and graders to find out compatibility issues.

Be sure run " module load gcc-9.2 " first.

Unzip the .zip and place "makefile" and "main.cpp" in your current directory.

Run "make" to get "linker"

./runit.sh <outputdir> ./linker

./gradeit.sh <your_reference_dir> <outputdir_from_last_command_above>

Then you will find out that how perfect my program is.
